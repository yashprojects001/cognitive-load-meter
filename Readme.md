## 🌈 What is Cognitive Load?
Cognitive Load is the **mental effort** required to process information.

Most apps measure **productivity**.  
This project measures **pressure**.

> ✨ *Not what you do — but how heavy it feels.*

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
**Cognitive Load Meter** estimates a user’s mental load in real time using **behavioral signals**, without cameras, wearables, or invasive tracking.

It observes:
- 🖱 Mouse movement intensity  
- 📜 Scroll frequency  
- 🔁 Tab switching behavior  

And converts them into a **live cognitive load score**.

## 🎯 Why This Project is Different
✅ No machine learning buzzwords  
✅ No fake AI claims  
✅ No productivity clichés  

Instead:
- 🧠 Psychology-driven logic  
- 🧩 Human behavior modeling  
- 🔐 Privacy-first design  

> “I focused on mental strain, not output.”

## 🧪 How It Works (Simple Logic, Deep Insight)

| Signal | Meaning | Weight |
|------|--------|--------|
| Mouse Movement | Restlessness | Low |
| Scroll Events | Information overload | Medium |
| Tab Switching | Task fragmentation | High |

These signals combine into a **Cognitive Load Score (0–100)**.

## 📊 Load Interpretation

| Score | State |
|-----|------|
| 🟢 0–30 | Calm Mind |
| 🟡 31–60 | Light Load |
| 🟠 61–85 | High Load |
| 🔴 86–100 | Cognitive Overload |

## 🎤 Interview Explanation (Steal This)
> “This project models cognitive load using indirect behavioral signals.  
Instead of tracking productivity, it captures mental strain — which is harder to measure and more meaningful.”

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
✨ Persistent load history  
✨ Daily/weekly load graphs  
✨ Focus alerts  
✨ Dark terminal UI  
✨ AI-based load explanations

## 📌 Philosophy Behind the Project
> *What we measure shapes how we live.*  
This project chooses **mental health over hustle metrics**.
